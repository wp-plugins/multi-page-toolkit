== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= To create pagetitles for your posts =

If you are using the visual editor, you will see two new buttons in the button bar. 

Click on Next Page to insert page breaks (nextpage).

Click on the page title button and in the popup - type in the required page title and click insert.
Icon will appear in the main editor window to show that the page title has been inserted. If you hover your mouse over the icon the page title will appear.
To edit the page title, select the page title icon in the main editor window and then click on page title button.

If you are not using the visual editor or are switched to CODE view
	
type in the following tag to create page breaks

	`<!--nextpage-->`

within each page add (including the starting page) to create page title

	`<!--pagetitle:TYPE IN PAGE TITLE HERE-->`
	
= Visual Editor does not show the new buttons =

The buttons will only work in Wordpress 2.5 and above only.

Please upgrade Wordpress.

= What is first and second instance on the options page mean? =

The different instances gives you the flexibilty to have two different navigation methods in your posts. This gives you the freedom to have a quick jump using page numbers and another drop down menu navigation method.

Each instance of multipage toolkit can be inserted in to the top , bottom or top and bottom of your post, or you can choose to have the first instance displayed at the top of your post and the second instance at the bottom. You are totally free to choose!!!

= Display ALL link, what is that? =

Some people on the web do not like multipage posts and they prefer to read posts as one long page. By selecting this option Multipage toolkit inserts a ALL pages link in to your quick jump or navigation links. On your quick jump you will see something like (Page: 1 2 3 4 ALL).

= Adjust Insert Priority, what is that? =

The problem with auto inserting things in to your posts is that you cannot control where they appear in relation to other items that are inserted. By changing the priority you can change where the navigation links appear in relation to other plugins.

e.g. If you use a plugin to generate related posts, ideally you want your navigation links to appear before the related posts listing - so by changing the priority value you can have the multipage toolkit appear before your related posts.

= Is there anywhere I can see multipage toolkit in action? =

Yes of course, my website is one place (http://www.tarkan.info).

I have also setup an example page to showcase the different options :-
